# 3D_SurvivalGame
A 3D game I made using C++ and SFML. It took me 3 weeks to finish. Hope you guys enjoy :)

How to play:

Use left and right arrow keys to control the players view. Use the up and down keys to move forward and backward.

Use space to kill an enemy.

Collect yellow squares to boost your health.
